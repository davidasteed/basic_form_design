Critical Path: 
This project will create a functional html form using label/input tag pairs, checkboxes, and radio buttons. 

a) add all of the html structure/content first
b) add css style for first element and validate that requestb.in does indeed receive the matching property/value.
c) add and validate the rest of the inputs
